Hi, I am Darlington Mafuratidze, 
a self-made engineer who thrives on creativity and innovation.
Specializing in Java-related frameworks and Unity game development,
I bring ideas to life with precision and flair. 
Beyond coding, I am also an artist, infusing my creations with imagination and artistry. 
From lines of code to pencil strokes, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible. 
Join me on a journey where technology meets artistry, and let's create something extraordinary together.
